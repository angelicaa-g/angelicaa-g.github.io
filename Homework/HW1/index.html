            <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>Artificial intelligence, also known as AI, refers to computer systems that are able to 
              think, learn, and solve problems in ways similar to humans. <br>
              These technologies can understand language, recognize patterns in data, 
               and make useful predictions or suggestions to help people and industries.</p>

            <h2>How AI Works?</h2>
            <p>AI works by combining large amounts of data with powerful algorithms 
              that allow machines to find connections, learn from examples, <br>
              and improve their performance over time. 
              The more quality data an AI system processes, the smarter and more accurate it becomes.</p>
